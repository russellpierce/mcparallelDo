Description: Provides a function that wraps 
    mcparallel() and mccollect() from 'parallel' with temporary variables and a 
    task handler.  Wrapped in this way the results of an mcparallel() call 
    can be returned to the R session when the fork is complete 
    without explicitly issuing a specific mccollect() to retrieve the value.
    Outside of top-level tasks, multiple mcparallel() jobs can be retrieved with 
    a single call to mcparallelDoCheck().
